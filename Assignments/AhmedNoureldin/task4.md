1. What is the option used to view the content of a compressed file.

    ```

    ```

2. Backup /etc directory using tar utility.

    ```

3. List the inode numbers of /, /etc, /etc/hosts.

    ```
    ls -i /   ;  ls -i /etc ; ls -i /etc/hosts

4. Copy /etc/passwd to your home directory, use the commands diff and cmp, and Edit in the file you copied, and then use these commands again, and check the output.

    ``` 
    cp /etc/passwd ~ 
    diff ~/passwd /etc/passwd
    cmp ~/passwd /etc/passwd
    vim ~/passwd
    diff ~/passwd /etc/passwd
    cmp ~/passwd /etc/passwd
    ```

```

```

6. Create a hard link of /etc/passwd in /boot. Could you? Why?
